# Loss-Functions-on-US-Crossing-Border-Database
This repository explores the application of various loss functions to model the complex dynamics of vehicle crossings at the US border. By analyzing the US Crossing Border Database, we aim to predict the types and volumes of vehicles crossing at different times, providing valuable insights for border management and planning.
